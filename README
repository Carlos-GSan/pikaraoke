## PiKaraoke

Karaoke song search and queueing system that uses Youtube videos as a source.

Supports

* Web interface for multiple users

* Searching song library via autocomplete

* Adding new tracks from Youtube

* Offline storage of video files

* Pause/Skip/Restart and volume control

* Now playing and up next display

* Queue editing

## Setup

Make sure you you have omxplayer (should be installed by default in Raspbian), but in case it's not:

`sudo apt-get install omxplayer`

Install youtube-dl:

`sudo pip install --upgrade youtube_dl`

(Do NOT use apt-get to install youtube-dl, it is an outdated version and puts it in a different directory than expected)

Install dependencies:

`sudo pip install cherrypy`

`sudo pip install futures`

`sudo pip install qrcode[pil]`

`sudo pip install psutil`

Bump up your GPU memory or some videos will show a GSOD (green screen of death). I had to do this on Pi Zero, not sure about Pi3:

`nano /boot/config.txt`

Add the following line:

`gpu_mem=128`

## Launch

cd to the pikaraoke directory and run:

`sudo python app.py`

Yes, you must run as sudo since pikaraoke uses pygame to control the screen.

Defaults to port 5000 and downloads songs to current working dir + /songs

To change that, you can supply command line arguments (example):

`python app.py --port 8080 --download-path /tmp/songs`

Point your devices web browsers to the IP:port of the rpi, add some songs, and start singing!
