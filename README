## PiKaraoke

Karaoke song search and queueing system that uses Youtube videos as a source. For use with Raspberry Pi devices.

### Features

*  Web interface for multiple users to queue tracks
*  Searching song library via autocomplete
*  Adding new tracks from Youtube
*  Offline storage of video files
*  Pause/Skip/Restart and volume control
*  Now playing and Up Next display
*  Basic editing of downloaded file names
*  Queue editing

### Supported Devices

This *Should* work on all raspberry pi devices, but multi-core models recommended. I did most development on a Pi Zero W and suffered greatly through optimizing to make usable performance for it, so it will work. However, certain things like concurrent downloads and browsing big song libraries will suffer. All this runs excellently on a Pi 3.

## Setup

Clone this repo to the directory of your choice:

```
cd <destination_directory>
git clone <this_repo_URL>
```

Make sure you you have omxplayer, which should be installed by default in Raspbian full versions (possibly not Lite though). To double-check, run:

```
which omxplayer
# Should return: /usr/bin/omxplayer
```

If it is not found you should be able to install it with:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install omxplayer
```

Install youtube-dl:

```
sudo pip install --upgrade youtube_dl
```

Note: Do NOT use apt-get to install youtube-dl, it is an outdated version and puts it in a different directory than expected.

Install these other dependencies:

```
sudo pip install cherrypy
sudo pip install futures
sudo pip install qrcode[pil]
sudo pip install psutil
```

Finally, bump up your GPU memory or some videos will show a GSOD (green screen of death).

`nano /boot/config.txt`

Add the following line:

`gpu_mem=128`

## Launch

cd to the pikaraoke directory and run:

`sudo python app.py`

Yes, you must run as sudo since pikaraoke uses pygame to control the screen buffer.

By default, the http port is 5000 and it downloads songs to "/usr/lib/pikaraoke/songs". To change this, you can supply the following command line arguments (example):

`python app.py --port 8080 --download-path /home/pi/songs`

## Auto-start PiKaraoke

Add the following to your /etc/rc.local file (paths and arguments may vary) to always start pikaraoke on reboot.

```
# start pikaraoke on startup
/usr/bin/python /home/pi/pikaraoke/app.py &
```

## Usage

Here is the full list of command line arguments:

```
usage: app.py [-h] [-p PORT] [-d DOWNLOAD_PATH] [-o OMXPLAYER_PATH]
              [-y YOUTUBEDL_PATH] [-v VOLUME] [-s SPLASH_DELAY] [-l LOG_LEVEL]
              [--hide-overlay] [--hide-ip] [--hide-splash-screen]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Desired http port (default: 5000)
  -d DOWNLOAD_PATH, --download-path DOWNLOAD_PATH
                        Desired path for downloaded songs. (default:
                        /usr/lib/pikaraoke/songs)
  -o OMXPLAYER_PATH, --omxplayer-path OMXPLAYER_PATH
                        Path of omxplayer. (default: /usr/bin/omxplayer)
  -y YOUTUBEDL_PATH, --youtubedl-path YOUTUBEDL_PATH
                        Path of youtube-dl. (default: /usr/local/bin/youtube-
                        dl)
  -v VOLUME, --volume VOLUME
                        Initial player volume in millibels. Negative values
                        ok. (default: 0 , Note: 100 millibels = 1 decibel)
  -s SPLASH_DELAY, --splash-delay SPLASH_DELAY
                        Delay during splash screen between songs (in secs).
                        (default: 4 )
  -l LOG_LEVEL, --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        Logging level int value (DEBUG: 10, INFO: 20, WARNING:
                        30, ERROR: 40, CRITICAL: 50). (default: 20 )
  --hide-overlay        Hide overlay in player showing song title and IP.
  --hide-ip             Hide IP address from the screen.
  --hide-splash-screen  Hide splash screen before/between songs.
```

## UI

Upon launch, the connected monitor/TV should show a splash screen with the IP of PiKaraoke along with a QR code.

Make sure you are connected to the same network/wifi. You can then enter the shown IP or scan the QR code on your smartphone/tablet/computer to open it in a browser. From there you should see the PiKaraoke web interface. It is hopefully pretty self-explanitory, but if you really need some help:

### Web UI

#### Home (Microphone Icon)

*  View Now Playing and Next tracks
*  Access controls to repeat, pause, skip and control volume

#### Queue

*  Edit the queue/playlist order (up and down arrow icons)
*  Delete from queue ( x icon )
*  Add random songs to the queue
*  Clear the queue

#### Songs

*  Add songs to the queue by searching current library on local storage (likely empty at first), search is executed autocomplete-style
*  Add new songs from the internet by using the second search box
*  Click browse to view the full library. From here you can edit files in the library (rename/delete).

#### Info

*  Shows the IP and QR code to share with others
*  Shows CPU / Memory / Disk Use stats
*  Allows user to quit to console, shut down, or reboot system

## Troubleshooting

#### Songs aren't downloading!

Make sure youtube-dl is up to date, old versions have higher failure rates due to changes in Youtube

`sudo pip install --upgrade youtube_dl`

#### Downloads are slow!

youtube-dl is very CPU intensive, especially for single-core devices like the pi models zero and less-than 2. The more simultaneous downloads there are, the longer they will take. Try to limit it to 1-2 at a time. Pi 3 can handle quite a bit more.

#### Where do I plug in a microphone?

Ideally, you'd have a mixer and amplifier that you could run the line out of the pi to, as well as the microphones.

The pi doesn't have a hardware audio input. Technically, you should be able to run a microphone through it with a USB sound card attached to the pi, but I personally wouldn't bother due to latency and quality issues. 

#### How do I change song pitch/key?

This is currently not supported due to lack of know-how. As far as I can tell we'd have to pipe omxplayer into some realtime-yet-lightweight audio DSP. Let me know if you have ideas on how to implement it.

In the meantime, you might be able to get away with running the line out through a pitch shift guitar effects pedal or similar device.
