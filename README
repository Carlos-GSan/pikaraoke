## PiKaraoke

Karaoke song search and queueing system that uses Youtube videos as a source.

Supports
* Web interface for multiple users
* Searching song library via autocomplete
* Adding new tracks from Youtube
* Offline storage of video files
* Pause/Skip/Restart and volume control
* Now playing and up next display
* Queue editing

## Setup

Make sure you you have omxplayer (should be installed by default in Raspbian), but in case it's not:

`sudo apt-get install omxplayer`

Install youtube-dl:

`sudo pip install --upgrade youtube_dl`

Install gunicorn and futures:

`sudo pip install gunicorn`
`sudo pip install futures`

Bump up your GPU memory or some videos will show a GSOD (green screen of death):

`nano /boot/config.txt`

Add the following line:

`gpu_mem=128`

## Launch

cd to the pikaraoke directory and run:

`gunicorn app:app -b 0.0.0.0:5000 --threads 50`

Change the http port and thread count as needed. The above example is port 5000 and 50 threads. You'll need at least as many threads as intended concurrent users of the web interface.

Point your devices web browsers to the IP:port of the rpi, add some songs, and start singing!
